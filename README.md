## Web Basics Series

Web Basics is a series on essential programming topics every web developer should absolutely know! The challenge is part of my Web Basics Series that I started on [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/SamanthaMing/).

Every lesson, I'll introduce a few important web development methods and provide examples on how to use them. At the end, you'll learned how to apply this knowledge in solving a web basics challenge. Exciting, right! ðŸ˜„
